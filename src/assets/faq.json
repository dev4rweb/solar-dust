    "question": "So this game uses NFTs… what are those, anyway?",
    "answer": "NFTs are unique tokens that have verifiable on-chain proof of ownership and verification. Anyone can verify the authenticity of an official asset on chain. Copies cannot be used in game and can easily be debunked as a copy. Some newcomers think you can screenshot an NFT and own it but that is hilariously not the case. If you photocopy a very rare pokemon, MTG or baseball card and try to sell it on ebay you won’t get 6 figures, because it’s obviously a fake. With NFTs, the on chain data is proof of authenticity & legitimacy."
