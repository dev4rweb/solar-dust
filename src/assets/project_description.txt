SolarDust is a collectible NFT RPG game built on the Solana Blockchain. There is an RPG battle experience in the metaworld, where you mine, harvest and fight other players. Once you have assembled your battle squad you can join the fray for SolarDust, where you strategically build your teams to beat your opponents in battle. The synergy of your team—based on how you match your strengths and compensate for weaknesses—could mean a winning streak for you. We've tried to take the best from the most popular collectible card games, such as Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone, and others. To start your journey, you need the NFT hero card. Our first randomized NFT collection will contain 10,000 unique elven heroes’ avatars of different rarity — your exclusive ticket into the greater SolarDust Metaverse
